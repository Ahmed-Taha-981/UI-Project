                    <h3>A Foodie’s Guide to Paris</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>1- Girafe</b>
                            The breezy outdoor terrace of this hyper-stylish restaurant is the place to park yourself at during warmer months, positioning you right onto Place du Trocadero with an unencumbered view of the Eiffel Tower. The menu majors in seafood and the limited vegetarian options (including a truffled pasta) are admittedly not all that memorable, although the experience certainly makes up for it with our afternoon unfurling at a languid pace, soundtracked by soft chatter and the delicate clink of wine glasses.

                        <li>
                            <b>2- Perruche</b>
                            
                            Translating to parakeet in French, Perruche is perched atop Le Printemps, one of our favourite Parisian department stores, lending a bird’s eye shot of the city’s skyline. If you can’t make it for a breezy brunch amidst their chic rooftop garden, worry not mon chérie. Perruche’ scenic bar is the ideal spot for a sunset cocktail too!

                        <li>
                            <b>3- Carette</b>
                            This rustic cafe in Paris’ oldest planned square, Place des Vosges, may be single-handedly responsible for making a viral Instagram-sensation of classic French-style hot chocolate. Decadently-dark and served with a heaping swoop of Chantilly cream – Carette’s signature cups of hot chocolate are nothing short of swoon-worthy, best paired with buttery bites of choux pastries!

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>4- Tekés</b>
                            
                            Translating to “ceremony” in Hebrew, the all-vegetarian restaurant is helmed by Assaf Granit, the chef credited with bringing bold Middle Eastern-Israeli cooking to Paris. Run by Cécile Levy, a chef of Franco-Moroccan and Israeli heritage, the eclectic menu marries a confluence of cultural inspirations with Jerusalem’ traditional cooking practices over charcoal, flames and ember. Dishes are spiced with the usual suspects from sumac to zaa’tar, but suffused with a startling twist. Sabich for instance (the classic pita-stuffed sandwich) metamorphoses into an open-faced sandwich layered with Japanese eggplant tempura. “Chicken liver” steals the show, starring caramelized onions and mushrooms mixed tableside. The evening is noisy, cheerful and a celebration in itself.

                        <li>
                            <b>5- Breizh</b>
                            Brunch is worth the accompanying wait at Breizh, a rustic pared-down café in the Marais district, championing Breton galletes. With its original outpost in Japan, Breizh is in fact the Breton word for the French region of Britanny. Their sweet and savoury buckwheat crêpes are a thing of beauty, delicately latticed and crisp around the edges, giving way to an unexpectedly-delicious compilation of fillings.
