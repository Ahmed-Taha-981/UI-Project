            <h3>Beautiful Responsible Tourism Destinations</h3>
            <ol>

                    <b>1- New Zealand</b>
                    <img src="images/blog3.1.jpg" alt="New Zealand" class="destination-image">
                    <b>New Zealand is one of the best responsible tourism destinations in the world. Ecotourism is the fastest-growing sector in the country’s tourism industry and you’re spoilt for choice of things to do.

                        There are over 10,000 protected areas, including reserves and 13 national parks. Visitors can enjoy plenty of educational activities, work on farms, take tours and learn about Maori culture.
                        
                        New Zealand is also one of my favourite destinations for solo travellers.</b>

                <li>
                    <b>2- Costa Rica </b>
                    <img src="images/blog3.2.jpg" alt="Costa Rica " class="destination-image">
                    Costa Rica is home to 6% of the world’s biodiversity so it comes as no surprise that the country is a world leader in conservation.

                    A prime location for ecotourists, more than 11% of Costa Rica is protected in national parks and reserves. Stunning ecolodges are also common throughout the country.

                    Thrilling highlights include spotting the local wildlife, hiking, volcano hopping, chocolate tours and ziplining through the rainforests.

                    <b>3- Republic of Palau</b>
                    <img src="images/blog3.3.jpg" alt="Palau" class="destination-image">
                    Palau is making waves on the sustainable travel scene.

                    A new initiative launched by the Palau Bureau of Tourism aims to mitigate the tourism sector’s carbon footprint and turn the country into the world’s first carbon-neutral destination.

                    This small island nation also has one of the world’s largest marine sanctuaries and tour operators and tourists are banned from using single-use plastic, non-reef-safe sunscreen and styrofoam.

                    For tips on how to cut plastic out of your packing list, check out my eco-friendly packing list.

                    Perhaps most significant of all, every visitor must sign the Palau Pledge on arrival to protect the country’s ecosystem.

                    <b>4- Bhutan </b>
                    <img src="images/blog3.4.jpg" alt="Bhutan" class="destination-image">
                    This small Buddhist kingdom located in the Himalayas has built its tourism industry with sustainability in mind.

                    All visitors must use a guide and pay US$65 per person for the number of days they’re planning to stay and the money is used for social development to sustain the country.

                    The preservation of the environment and culture is a key part of Bhutan’s ethos and it’s understandable when 72% of its territory is covered in forests.

                    Bhutan is also the world’s only carbon-negative country, producing fewer carbon emissions than its forests absorb. Goals!

                    <b>5- The Maldives</b>
                    <img src="images/blog3.5.jpg" alt="maldives" class="destination-image">
                    The Maldives is a top luxury holiday destination, however, this archipelago of islands and atolls has stepped up its game to ensure that its fragile ecosystem is protected.

                    To eliminate the scourge of plastic waste, some resorts have set up their own recycling and glass water bottling plants.

                    Fishing is strictly regulated to manage the marine life and visitors must pay a US$6 Green Tax per person per day. If you love the ocean then the Maldives is the place to be.

                    Highlights include sailing trips and diving alongside turtles and whale sharks. You can also absolutely visit the Maldives as a solo traveller. It’s not just for honeymooners!
